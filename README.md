# Slate Basic
A Starterkit theme with basic layout spacing and component styling improvements.

I have a work.css in the CSS directory for development purposes with a weight set to 0. The work here will be moved to separate files.

## Global Layouts and Styles

### Typography & Fonts
(Info coming)

### Grids and Layouts
(Info coming)

### Vertical Spacing (Block)

## Components and Elements
Following is a list of elements that are covered. This is not currently an extensive list but a checklist of sorts. It will be updated as I work towards documenting a basic
starter theme's needs.
The Starterkit theme has all the component styles in separate files. This
repository adds to these. <br>
If you use this theme as a starter then you can
modify these to suit your design.(instructions on how to use this as a
child theme coming)<br>
You can also merge these styles into a new copy of Starterkit. (Instruction
coming of how to do this.)

### Components
Components are a combination of elements. Generally, the elements are set in
the global styles. However, in some cases, a component will have a unique
style for an element.

- Menus
- Bread crumb
- Pagination
- Views teaser
- Blocks
  - Recent Content etc. (List coming)
- Tasks
  - Node
  - User login, create account, and reset password.
- Tables
- Tabs

## Forms
Light mode is default, but where needed I have adjusted HTML5 elements for dark mode across browsers.
The theme doesn't come with a dark mode as such, however.
