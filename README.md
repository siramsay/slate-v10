# Slate Basic
A Starterkit Theme with Basic Layout and Component improvements.

For development purposes, I have a work.css in the CSS directory with a weight set to 0. The work here will be moved to separate files.

## Global Layouts and Styles

### Typography & Fonts

### Grids and Layouts

## Components and Elements
Following is a list of element that are covered. This is not currently an extensive list and is a checklist of sorts. It will be updated as I work towards documenting a basic
starter theme's needs.
The Starterkit theme has all the component styles in separate files. This
repository adds to these. <br>
If you use this theme as a starter then you can
modify these to suit your design. (instructions on how to use this as a
child theme coming)<br>
You can also merge these styles into a new copy of Starterkit. (Instruction
coming of how to do this.)

### Components
Components are a combination of elements. Generally the elements are set in
the Global styles. However, in some case a component will have a niques
style for an elememt.
